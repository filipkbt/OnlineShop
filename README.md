# OnlineShop

## Description: 
I realized the project of an online store offering the purchase of programming courses in order to learn and use ASP.NET MVC technology in practice. 

The online store offers purchase of programming courses. 

There are two roles in it: 
* Users 
* Administrators

On the main page we have a section with randomly generated 6 courses that have the "Bestseller" or "New" flags assigned. 

Thanks to the Elmah.MVC tool, the administrator has access to the history of errors that occurred during the use of the site by users. 

## Used technologies: 
* .NET(ASP.NET MVC)
* Entity Framework
* LINQ
* MS SQL 2017
* Elmah.MVC
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* AJAX
* JQuery
* Bootstrap 4.0 

## Design pattern: 
MVC
